# Motivation
* A lot of accidents take place because a driver who is a human being
driving a car gets distracted.
* Continuous driving can cause stress and fatigue which makes us tired
and sleepy.
* It is harder for a human being to focus on multiple tasks at the same
time.
* A self-driving car can automatically drive itself where a human effort
is minimized as much as possible.
* Self-driving cars are very efficient at making decisions and could take
care of multiple things at the same time.

# Problem Definition
To build a steering wheel angle prediction system and simulate it on a video.

# Data
* We have collected the dataset called as `Autopilot-Tensorflow`
* The dataset contains images of a front dash camera view of a driving car showing angle of a road and corresponding
steering wheel angles.
* The size of the dataset is 45,408 images.
* Looking at one image, as human beings we can say that we have to
rotate a steering wheel angle or not.

# Output
* Simulation of a steering wheel on a video. The steering wheel will be rotating according to the angle of the road.
